# **openzeppelin-uups-proxies**

**A** practical guide to UUPS proxy upgrades with Foundry â€” learn the UUPS pattern, understand its advantages, and follow step-by-step instructions to implement and upgrade smart contracts securely.

## **Overview**

**This** repository demonstrates how to use the **UUPS** (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) proxy pattern for upgradeable smart contracts using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library and Foundry as your development framework.

**The** UUPS proxy pattern enables:

- **Minimal** proxy footprint  
- **Gas-efficient** upgrades  
- **Explicit** upgrade control within your implementation contract  
- **Compatibility** with OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts  

## **Prerequisites**

**Before** getting started, make sure you:
